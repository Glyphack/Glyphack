Diverse book on a lot of topics around software.
I was surprised how much it is still relevant.
The book gives first hand experience about working in big companies and finding good developers.

There are a lot of technical suggestions in the book. Like writing specs, good dev tools(did it even exist 25 years ago?) All are relevant. There are solutions for them but they are still around.

One notable example is daily code check-in test scripts. Today we have all of this CI/CD stuff all over the place.
The tools are here but in the past experience I've seen a lot of teams that are not using them.
It's just something that should be there because everyone has it.

Also good writing advice, I liked the idea of writing software specs with fictional characters that are using it and explaining their experience instead of talking about the software.
