Fantastic Book. This book shows the true meaning of a curios person.
I love curios people. I also love nonchalant people. Feynman is both.

In the first chapters from his childhood to university there are stories about how got interested in many subjects.
He did experiments on ribosomes in biology labs during his time at MIT. Just to learn more.

He says hypnotism is interesting because when someone is performing it on you, you don't think anything is happening until it actually happens.
You keep telling yourself that you are aware of the situation and can walk out at any moment until you cannot.
Which is funny because most things in life sound like that.
You tell yourself something is easy I can do it.
Or you can easily change something but you just don't want it.
But in the end until you actually try to do it you don't understand you cannot.

He was at Los Alomos during WW2. He became famous for cracking all the locks and safes there.
Getting any secret document he needed without having the key to the locks.
He even did this trick to lieutenants.
Normally you would take people in the army serious and don't play these tricks with them.
But he does not.
