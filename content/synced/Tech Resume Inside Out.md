It was a good and light read. I picked it up while I was preparing my resume for job searched and I think it was the last thing I read on writing resumes.

It can replace reading blog posts online about how to write a resume or resume builder websites.
It does not contain any fluff. You can read it before you write your resume and it contains good advice.
