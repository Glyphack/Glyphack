The story of [[John Carmack|John Carmack]] and [[John Romero|John Romero]] is entertaining, dramatic and inspirational.

I think the book also motivates you.
Since you see how much challenges they overcome to make it all work.

The book starts by describing two young boys with video game addiction who end up in a well situation.

They used their work computers over the night to create games that was impossible before they created them.

I also got the other book [[The Doom Guy|The Doom Guy]] it's the same story but written by [[John Romero|John Romero]].
Mostly because in this book there's a funny story that the two johns get into a fight because Carmack was working 14 hours a day and Romero was not working as much and Romero leaves the company.
I want to know the other side of story as well.
