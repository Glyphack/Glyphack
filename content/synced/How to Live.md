## Review  
  
I loved this book. The book promised "27 conflicting answers and one wierd conclusion" and it delivered it word by word.  
  
You can live by following almost any idealogy. They are good when you start it and end up as poor decisions when taken into extreme.  
  
Everybody hears this as a child.  
What makes this book different is that it describes the life following only one belief.  
To me this was like a wake up call, because I realized how I was missing out on some ideas because I thought there are right and wrong ways to live.  
  
It is smart to plan for short term, making sure you are in a good position now.  
It is also smart to plan for the long term, making sure you end up in a good position.  
It is good to live for yourself, being able to fulfill your own needs.  
It is good to live with others, provide and receive goods.  
  
While reading it I realized that I liked different answers that are conflicting. So what I wanted was conflicting.  
This book motivated me to try ideas that I would not try otherwise, because there is no way to live.  
  
I want to revisit these answers from the book:  
  
- Let randomness rule  
- Make a million mistakes  
- Intertwine with the world  
- Do nothing
