Nice book. I think I would have learned a lot from it if I read it before writing a compiler. The content were what I knew already.
I think it's a good resource for the first thing you want to read if you haven't written anything in compilers.
Also I already read quite [few resources about compilers](https://glyphack.com/compiler-resources/).

I am going to read the sequel, Write a compiler in go. That should have new stuff for me.

I liked the idea that the book had code examples and step by step added everything.
It was good since you can see exactly what next few sections are implementing and decide to skip it.
I didn't like the amount of test code in the book.
It was repetitive and obvious.
Specially writing every single assert by hand vs snapshot testing.
