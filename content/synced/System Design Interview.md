I started this book not to prepare for interviews but to learn about this concept of system design.
I was new to the topic so thought getting this book would be good. Especially because the author has been doing this for some time.

After reading through the book I found that it is only useful for interviews. It actually helped me with a system design interview.
I don't think it worth reading. Unless you are starting out and have an interview coming up and want to prepare for it the night the interview.

The alternative is books like [[Architecture of open source applications & 500 lines or less|Architecture of open source applications & 500 lines or less]] books that give practical examples of how to create applications.
Also doing is more important than just reading in this topic. You can easily say "X does not scale"just because you read it, it's not true.
