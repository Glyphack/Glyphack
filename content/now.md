This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), with what I'm thinking and working on.
You should make one too.


Updated Jan 4th, 2026 from Amsterdam. Where it's now snowy.

## Contributing to [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) Python Type Checker

I took a break end of the last year.
This year it's in my plan to contribute even more.
I love Python and I think it's going to get even better.

## Talking at FOSDEM

I'm also giving a talk at fosdem this [February](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/GWRDNT-rust-type-checking-python/) on ty.

## Building A Logic Gate Simulator

I worked on my logic gate simulator in the past fall.
It's been on my mind for maybe 4 5 years to build a better Logisim in the browser.
It is now live.
[Try it out](https://github.com/Glyphack/simu).


## Gardening

I harvested a lot of Bell peppers and tomatoes last year.
Everything was working out fine until my plants got a terrible pest.
It was the white fly. That came with a mint plant that I found on the street.
I took the plant, and learned a lesson. That everything can teach something new.
Now I know about [white fly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitefly).

Saffron plants are still healthy.
They come out of the soil every year in fall and then go back to sleep.
I harvested from only one of them.

I'm going to plant other stuff in the next spring.
My goal is more herbs that I can use in cooking. Fresh.

## 40 Questions

I just answered [40 questions to ask yourself every year](https://stephango.com/40-questions) with Yasmin and Farbod.
What a year! It was awesome.
This year I'm gonna risk more.

## AI

My experience of AI is not what X says these days.
People are putting multiple of these agents to code.
What is the thing they want to get out of it?
More text that looks like code?

I use it a lot and it's not 100% correct so definitely requires reviewing.
So having tens of these things generate is gonna be so much to review.
It requires guidance and prompting.
Sometimes I describe the thing with I want with so much precision that it's almost as if I wrote it.
I use it on simple tasks, it's good because I know what I want and can guide it.
I use it on complex tasks, if I don't understand what's going I read it.
Because if I don't know the code it added then I cannot think how it's going to work in the context of the project.
But still this is beneficial.
I can ask it to do something and see how a solution could look like and get ideas.
You know, like a whiteboard that is more interactive for thinking.

But I'm using it in different places.
I'm happy with the productivity boost.
At the same time I think there are people who are solely promoting it because they have a chance to get attention.

I've used it for reading my posts helping with grammar and typos.
I use it to ask questions that were otherwise to time consuming to answer.

## Cooking

I'm gonna cook more dishes from [YummyGastronomy](https://www.youtube.com/@YummyGastronomy).
I think a new section on blog would be good.
