## Contributing to Red Knot Python Type Checker

Initially I wanted to build my own type checker.
After some time I found out about red knot that is another work in progress python type checker.
Since developing a type checker for python is a lot of work I decided to dedicate my effort to contribute to this project.

## Got a 3D Printer

I bought a 3D printer. I printed prepared models and it's pretty cool.
Now I'm trying to learn how to design my own models.

## Gardening

It all started when I saw some seed packages in the supermarket now  I have 20+ pots.
I'm harvesting herbs. It feels good to make food with my own herbs.

Some of the things I have harvested:
- parsely
- basil
- mint
- potato
- mangold
- bell pepper
- saffron
- tomato
