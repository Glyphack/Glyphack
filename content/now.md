## Release Enderpy Python Type Checker

Update 30-06-2024: Daniel Woznicki, a new contributor joined the project.

I'm so interested in developer tools, so interested that I decided to build a tool myself.
The goal is to be faster than other type checkers.
It involves reading and digesting a lot of topics related to compilers, Python, and Rust.

I keep the project status on its homepage: <https://github.com/glyphack/enderpy>

I always wanted to work in a company where the product is a dev tool.
But it's not so easy to get into one with a resume full of web development.
The project also gives me experience and knowledge required to work on what I like more.

## Learning Dutch

I think learning Dutch would be a huge quality of life improvement.
After about 40 hours now I can read and understand dutch. Hearing is still hard but I can do greeting with others in dutch.

## Gardening

I'm practicing growing plants in my apartment both for decoration and consumption.
This is another step to be a little bit more independent.

I have 20+ pots and I'm harvesting herbs. It feels good to make food with my own herbs.
I got a gardening pot and going to fill that with soil on the balcony and grew larger plants.

## Self Hosting

I'm trying to eliminate my use of cloud based technologies.
Instead, I'm trying to use software that is local, or open source, or I own the data.
It's a big change, I'm practicing with self-hosting some software on my Raspberry Pi.

It's fascinating that the stuff I have to do to set up servers is so different from my day job.
In my day job we live few levels of abstraction above the running server.
I don't even know who runs the code I deploy and how.

I want to rely on things that a single person can maintain.

Right now I'm hosting my own:

- Chat Server (Matrix Dendrite)
- VPN
- YouTube Clone

## Getting a Cat

I'm going to visit a shelter soon and adopt a cat!
