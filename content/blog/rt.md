I created a site to share your favorite RSS Feeds in a page.
The idea comes from one of my favorite sites [usesthis.com](https://usesthis.com).

[Try it out](https://r.glyphack.com) and send me your links.
I love to know interesting blogs around the internet. Here is [mine](https://r.glyphack.com/s/76ead3b6-63cf-4104-8ab1-ff9af9a0ea2b).

I spend great time reading stuff on the internet. I started this in high school.
I think it's getting harder everyday to find good content.
For me a good writing is the one with thoughts behind it.
Which is hard to get in the world that everyone is fighting for your attention.

So I started collecting blogs that I like. I decided that I'm gonna be reading only those posts.
I limited the number of posts I see and I can choose from to read. But the quality went higher.
From time to time, I share these blogs with my friends. They share blogs with me too. And I love it.
Now I have a collection that I really like. I might add more or less stuff to them but it's almost enough for my entire life.

So I created this website where we can share and find interesting blogs.
