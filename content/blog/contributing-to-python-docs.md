I think I learned something about contributing to open source that, if I knew a couple of years back, I could have done much more open source contributions.

A while back, I started creating a [hand-written parser for Python](https://github.com/Glyphack/enderpy).
I ended up also contributing some fixes to Python docs.
This was particularly interesting to me because it did not require really advanced knowledge, and the stuff there that was incorrect or outdated had been there for years.
So why didn't I do this earlier?

It was because I never exposed myself to the opportunity.
I usually avoided reading docs from start to finish or diving into the code of the tool I was using.

The [first](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/104986) & [second PR](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/104986) were the result of reading the grammar and `ast` package docs and finding inconsistencies.

Well, I think that when we start out programming, it's best to be exposed to these opportunities of reading the actual framework/tool documentation and trying to understand and contribute if there's something to improve.
Or just, in general, look more into the source rather than reaching for tutorials.
