## Chat with New People

I chatted with [Amir](https://amirhn.com/). Turns out it was a good decision to live stream writing Redis in C from scratch.
Met Matt from [Blinkinlabs](https://blinkinlabs.com/about).

## Simu

Worked on:

- Polishing the UI, You can click drag a pin to connect it to another pin.
- Various dragging actions for dragging and keeping the connection, drag both ends of the wire and drag only one end of the wire.
- Draft for connecting a wire to middle of another wire. <https://youtu.be/ROll1Qz64OQ>

You can watch me [here](https://youtu.be/ROll1Qz64OQ?t=295) using it to build a multiplexer. The UI is finally easy and fast to use.

## Book Reader

Book reader project. I had this project from a long time ago and I stopped using it. Now my girlfriend is using the reader so I spend more time working on it.

## Ty

Ty worked on the [self feature]({{< relref "blog/ty-self.md" >}}) a bit and then I'm taking a break. I'll get back this week.
Most of the blocking issues are resolved by others. They did the super hard part.

## Books

I started reading [Data Oriented Design]({{< relref "synced/Data Oriented Design.md" >}})

- [Creativity, Inc.]({{< relref "synced/Creativity, Inc..md" >}})
